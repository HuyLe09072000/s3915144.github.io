            <div>   In the second week of study, two lessons provide knowledge related to the construction of argument structures, the synthesis of ideas, effective summary speech, and the methods of persuasive presentations. Instructor Peter Farrell started students analyzing and comparing arguments by building on good reasoning. Students practiced paraphrasing and summarizing while using citation styles such as citation-referencing, direct quotes, and synthesizing material from several sources. In topic 4, Dr. Jonathan Crellin guided students to develop technical report writing structures that support science and engineering disciplines. Furthermore, the structures formed will be a key element in supporting the presentation exercise and the future discipline. He presents the keys to leading pupils with clear goals, substance, and analysis for essays and presentations, based on his extensive expertise. Students took an extensive look at the audience's standard, compared slides to get a solid idea of the situation and meticulously prepared presentations. Interaction with the audience is also an important factor mentioned at the end of the lesson.</div>

The practice session at the end of the Thursday session assisted students in mastering and developing what they had learned. Furthermore, instructor Jonathan Crellin's online lesson was chock-full of new information to pique students' interest with vivid comparison examples. When students work together to accomplish group activities and communicate in between individual exercises, they have a very professional attitude. This has been a very successful week for the students' receptivity and the full transmission of the teachers.</div>

            <div>                                The knowledge I gained from the two courses was tremendously beneficial since it reinforced my deficiencies from the prior UniStart class and gave me greater confidence in presenting logical arguments. In addition, I can quickly synthesize and produce ideas from a large amount of data from a range of sources. Not only did I improve my ability to express myself clearly, but I also learned more about the conventional framework for technical essays in Lesson 4. In science and technology, presentations are critical because students must be able to comprehend facts and transmit them to an audience without becoming bored, as well as enable them to develop a strong sympathy for the individual presentation. For example, new technology products or platforms want to be absorbed by users or audiences we need to have a corresponding purpose and application. Dr. Jonathan Crellin has aided students in producing ideas and slides for effective presentations, making the learning experience more confident for them. And educator Peter Farrell, who emphasized and added objective components to assist students to improve their ability to acquire information from a variety of sources.</div>

            <div>          I am required to keep the aspects of standards for future engineering activities in the School of Science and Technology environment at RMIT Vietnam. I need to have a keen, creative mind and practice the aspects to become more professional to become a scientific and technology developer. I learned about argument structure, technical essays, and presenting abilities throughout the second week of study. I need a path to practice my knowledge from basic to advance in the science and engineering school atmosphere at RMIT to become more professional in the future. Initially, I put up a routine for utilizing weekly report cards to practice idea development and create a cohesive structure for future articles. To increase writing abilities, this activity requires a particular duration of practice 2-4 times a week for 1-3 months. Furthermore, I have many issues with my presenting abilities, including fluency in communication, organization of ideas, inventiveness in presentation, and audience involvement. During my time at science and engineering school, however, my primary aim was to improve my communication skills. As a result, I decided to use the time after finishing the essay to provide myself or my students with the staged assessment. This is a communication-oriented ability that may be used in professional communication daily. </div>

            <div>   The third and fourth weeks are two special weeks of events such as Christmas and New Year. Furthermore, the fourth week of study is an extremely useful week with direct foundational knowledge for engineering students. Research and the background factors related to it are the focus explored in topic 5. Students have approached topics about research thesis such as concept, structure, inductive reasoning, and inference. In addition, Dr. Jonathan Crellin brought "research paradigms" and research analysis methods to help students easily understand the 'fulcrum' to develop future research papers. Moreover, the professor also mentioned the introduction, the formula of "the data-ink ratio" and enhanced the knowledge of previous topics related to reference pages.</div>

            <div>           This is a topic that is new, and extremely important for students of engineering school. However, the learning atmosphere is not vibrant, and class activities are limited because the lesson plans are taught online. The knowledge is relatively difficult to grasp, and students need more effort to succeed. In addition, some students who have not understood the lesson still have the problem of being hesitant to ask the professor, and some small factors make online classes prevent students from absorbing the lesson. Nonetheless, Dr. Jonathan Crellin delivered the lesson very passionately and imparted the knowledge needed to the class to help students solve some of the difficulties.</div>

Dr. Jonathan Crellin utilized comparisons to assist students to understand various facets of data structure and analysis, from objective to subjective, and the session was a success. Furthermore, he also introduced data analysis tools, specific visualizations, and differences in analytical research. Students' classroom success has been the acquisition of information that complements technical reports and provides confidence in bringing real proof to the table through the production of reference pages. What impressed me most about the lesson was the basis of "the value of data-ink ratio" and knowing the difference between inductive and deductive reasoning. "The value of data-ink ratio" helps me to be effective in drawing future analytical charts or maps, and reasoning methods help me be more thoughtful in writing research papers.</div>

            <div>     The creation of research papers requires many basic elements that not only prescribe reference pages but also bring specific evidence from outside and provide detailed arguments. The selection of arguments from many aspects helps to increase the persuasiveness of the research. Moreover, it is very important to give the research legitimacy because it will bring professionalism to the research. </div>

            <div>         Over the last two weeks, I've been practicing crafting arguments, which has given me greater confidence. I felt fairly competent in integrating the usage of evidence to support the arguments in the research paper after accepting the understanding of topic 5. Confidence, however, is insufficient since I must educate my mind to avoid even the most fundamental errors. I have been learning how to make reference pages for the past several weeks, and this week I've been brushing up on my abilities. I was also told that I needed to make particular reference pages for research papers. In the past, I've chosen to practice writing 2-4 times a week, and I'll use a combination of inductive and deductive reasoning to judge my progress. Because I give presentations before gatherings with friends, my presentation skill has improved. At first, my voice was unsteady and broken. I've steadily developed and grown more fluent in my language. I've steadily progressed and gotten more fluent in my oral presentation, and I'll continue to do so in the future by providing evidence and arguments, minimizing the number of slides I show, and boosting audience participation.

            <div>   Lesson 6 is a supplementary knowledge lesson that teaches students how to develop clear goals for a group research project. Dr. Jonathan Crellin piqued students' curiosity with three study subject proposals, and they came up with a slew of new ideas, including nanobots, "financial" AI, and computer technology. In addition, the professor clearly explained the specific roles of each individual in a group project, and from there the students were able to easily identify and discuss group selection. Lesson 7 is a lesson that teaches students how to discern and pick techniques such as reading, ideation, critical thinking, self-awareness, and other forms of argumentation, as well as how to be confident and engaged in learning activities. In both classes, Dr. Jonathan Crellin gave students two simple tests to identify role categories and individual scores. For example, I am a Consul (ESFJ-T) and have stats like Visual 8 Aural 6 Read/Write 8 Kinesthetic 8.</div>

In addition, group thinking activities helped the students choose their favorite project group. The students had mostly covered the theory in two sessions. Dr. Jonathan Crellin's way of communicating is extremely slow and easy to understand, he is always waiting for students to understand and teach in detail. Silence in online classrooms, on the other hand, is a flaw that must be addressed. I'm not as enthusiastic about online education as I used to be. Perhaps the other students and I should be more involved.</div>

          <div class="timeline-body px-4 pb-4">My study on these two topics has been extremely positive because the knowledge-enhancing values help to support research as well as argumentative activities. I have grasped my learning situation and clearly defined my learning direction. In addition, the experience and knowledge of Professor Jonathan Crellin contain ideas that are extremely relevant to the student's criteria. I planned and distributed the group work very efficiently for a certain time, and chose the objective for my presentation in the group research project. More than that, I feel confident when I state my opinion in front of other students and make my judgments more accurate.</div>

            <div>     The topic of group activities is the foundation to help students have a reasonable structure of research on the topic, and the topic "Active & Independent Learning" helps students to have independent thinking to develop their ideas. Individual ideas for group work exercises. </div>

            <div>        I formed a team with three other students to study "classical" weapons, and we built on the foundation learned in Lesson 6 to develop and allocate certain roles. All it takes is for students to work independently to come up with bold ideas for future presentations. Alignment and the exchange of ideas are planned to develop logical and unified argument construction. We had a specific time for the research project, and thanks to topics like how to present and how to build a paper I believe that group 1's paper is very desirable.

          </div>
          <div class="timeline-body px-4 pb-4">
            <div>   The last two weeks of engineering and technology school at RMIT are two very special weeks because the classes are taught by guest lecturers. Although the students were not well understood, the lecturers brought a lively atmosphere and useful knowledge. In addition, the students referred to short films in stages to better grasp the topic. It made sense to ask countless questions, and the instructors explained the questions in great detail and with enthusiasm. The topics covered by the lecturers included computer interaction (User-Centered Design), information technology, embedded systems, and engineering technologies.</div>

            <div>           These seminars, in my opinion, have been effective because they have supplied students with a source of helpful and complementary knowledge for their eventual degrees. In addition, the professors addressed my queries and revealed to me previously undiscovered aspects of technology. The learning atmosphere is sometimes quiet, but the instructors and support from Dr. Jonathan Crellin help students get real images related to technology topics. The level of interaction between the lecturers and the students is amazing, the messages are completely conveyed.</div>

          <div class="timeline-body px-4 pb-4">Professors' expertise is incredibly extensive, including everything from human aspects to software and hardware components of the machine system. The lesson's effectiveness depends on the students' understanding of their future academic and employment objectives. Furthermore, pupils can recognize complementing parts of technology. I am very interested in the field of mechatronics, and the class taught by the third guest lecturer allowed me to see most of the mechatronic devices thru structures based on the embedded systems. I think I have succeeded in understanding the theoretical background and workings. I have developed a general knowledge of machine learning.</div>

            <div>    The three lessons were the transmission of early information about technology and computers to students at the school of science and technology, and the guest speakers provided a breath of new air by bringing imprecise knowledge in the field of science and technology to the surface. </div>

            <div>       During the process of acquiring knowledge in science and technology school, I have developed some hard and soft skills. It was the foundation that made me more confident when taking science and technology-related classes in the future. Presentation skills and research completion have improved in almost six weeks. Comments from Dr. Jonathan Crellin helped me gain useful information. I think in the future this is a journey worth looking back on and improving day by day. As I continue to work on skills related to science and technology, information-seeking skills will be new elements I need to add and practice in the future.
